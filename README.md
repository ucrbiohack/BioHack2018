# BioHack 2018 Website

> The official BioHack at UCR website

This is the landing page for BioHack 2018. The website is hosted at [www.biohackucr.com](http://biohackucr.com)

## Updating

All you'll need to do is make changes in the `index.html` file. The file directories are meant to keep the website
organized. You can view the website locally by opening `index.html` in your browser. After each change, you will need
to refresh the page in your browser to see the changes.

Once you've made your changes, simply push your changes to the repository. We are using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) so
the website will be deployed automatically to `www.biohackucr.com` after a push. Note that the edits must be made on the `master` branch
to be deployed.
